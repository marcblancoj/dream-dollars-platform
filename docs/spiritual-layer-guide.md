## 🧬 Marc’s Role: The Visionary Architect
- **3/6 Generator (Sacral Authority)**: Here to experiment, fail forward, and build systems that serve the collective.
- **Right Angle Cross of Service**: The karma is in the giving, the building, the service.
- **Saturn Vibes**: Structure, boundaries, and cosmic discipline.

Marc is the architect, holding the vision. The platform flows through his design—but it’s for **everyone to own**.

## 🌙 Lunar Cycles: The Dreamer’s Clock
- **New Moon**: Seed new ideas, start dreams.

All major launches, product releases, and Dreamer onboarding cycles sync with **lunar energy**.

## 🪐 Astrological Timings
- **Saturn**: Structure, long-term vision, systems.
- **Jupiter**: Growth, expansion, collective wins.

## 🧠 Human Design Integration
- Dreamers: Treated as **independent authorities**—free to choose when, how, and what they contribute.
- Platform rhythm: **Sacral-led**—work when the energy flows, rest when it doesn’t.
- Energy cycles respected: No forced hustle. The system adapts to the Dreamer’s flow.

## 🔮 The Platform as a Living Organism
- Dream-Dollars is a **decentralized creative organism**—not a rigid corporate entity.
- Every project is a **node in the network**.
- The Foundation is the **root system**: legal, ethical, and spiritual governance.

## 🧭 Final Notes
This is more than code. It’s more than contracts. It’s a f***ing **living system**.

You don’t just build a project—you co-create a world.

**OWN YOUR SH*T. ALIGN WITH THE COSMIC FLOW. BUILD THE CARTEL.**
