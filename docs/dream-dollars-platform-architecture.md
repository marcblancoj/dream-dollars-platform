# Dream-Dollars Platform Architecture

## üß¨ Core Vision
Dream-Dollars is a decentralized, punk-as-f**k creative production platform where talent earns equity‚Äînot paychecks. No investors. No bosses. No flipping tokens. Just creators owning their sh*t.

**Own Your Sh*t.** Work = equity. Sweat = ownership.
