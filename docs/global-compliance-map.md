## üõ°Ô∏è Core Compliance Principles
- **Dream-Dollars = Contractual Equity**: Non-transferable, non-tradable, non-speculative units earned solely through work.
- **No Employment Relationship**: Dreamers are independent contractors, responsible for their own taxes and legal obligations.
- **Tax Responsibility**: Dreamers must comply with their local tax laws. Platform provides templates (W-9/W-8BEN, VAT, T4A).
- **Data Privacy**:
  - Pseudonymous profiles by default.
  - Legal names collected only for contracts/tax compliance.
  - GDPR/CCPA compliant: minimal data collection, encrypted storage.
- **Securities Law Compliance**:
  - Dream-Dollars are **not a security**, **not an investment**, **not a token**.
  - Explicit disclaimers in all contracts and platform terms.
- **Dispute Resolution**: Binding arbitration under ICC/UNCITRAL rules, seated in Valencia, Spain.
