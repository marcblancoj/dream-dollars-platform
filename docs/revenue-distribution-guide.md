# Revenue Distribution Guide: Dream-Dollars Platform

## üí∏ How the Money Flows

Dream-Dollars is a **work-for-equity platform**‚Äîwhen the project earns, you earn. Here‚Äôs how **revenue flows from sales to payouts**.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Sources of Revenue
Dream-Dollars projects make money through:
- Pre-sales (tickets, access passes)
- Merchandise (physical & digital)
- Streaming revenue
- Syndication/licensing deals
- Donations

No investors. No speculation. Just **real cash from real products**.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Revenue Collection
- **Stripe Connect** handles all incoming payments.
- Platform collects a **small % fee** (for legal defense fund + operational costs).
- Remaining funds go to the **Project Treasury**.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Annual Payout Cycles
- Payouts happen **once per year**, within 90 days of project revenue receipt.
- Revenue is distributed proportionally to Dreamers based on their final Dream-Dollar balance.
- Payout reports are generated for transparency.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ The Math
- Each Dreamer‚Äôs payout = (Their Dream-Dollar balance √∑ Total Dream-Dollars issued) x Total Net Revenue.
- Example: 
  - You hold 10,000 Dream-Dollars.
  - The project has 100,000 total Dream-Dollars issued.
  - The project earns $500,000.
  - Your cut: (10,000 / 100,000) x 500,000 = **$50,000**.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Lifetime Payouts
- Dreamers receive payouts **for the lifetime of the project** (e.g., ongoing streaming, syndication).
- No equity dilution. No time limit. If the project earns, you earn.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Early Exit Option
- Dreamers can choose to **cash out Dream-Dollars early** (if the project‚Äôs cash flow allows).
- This terminates their ownership in the project.

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Dreamer Dashboard
- All payout data is available in the **Dreamer Dashboard**:
  - Revenue received.
  - Payout amounts.
  - Transaction history.

---

## üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è The Code
- No flipping. No speculation. No investors taking your cut.
- Work = equity. Revenue = payouts. That‚Äôs the system.

**OWN YOUR SH*T. GET PAID.**
