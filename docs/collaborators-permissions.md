# Collaborators Permissions: Dream-Dollars Platform

## 🧬 The Power Structure

The Dream-Dollars platform runs like a **punk creative cartel**—but every cartel needs structure. Here’s how **roles and permissions** work for collaborators inside a project.

## 🔑 Roles & Access Levels

| Role                   | Permissions                                                                                                     | Privacy Access                                  |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 🏗️ **Creator (Founder)**   | Full control: contracts, tasks, payouts, Dream-Dollar ledger, Dreamer data, legal settings, governance      | Full access (all data, Dreamer names, legal docs) |
| 🎬 **Project Director**    | Manage tasks, approve/reject deliverables, propose contracts (needs Creator final sign-off), view Dreamer data | Pseudonymous Dreamer data + contract previews     |
| 📝 **Project Manager**     | Create/assign tasks, track progress, view deliverables, view Dream-Dollar balances (no contract editing)      | Pseudonymous profiles only (no legal names)      |
| 🔍 **Collaborator (Read-Only)** | View project page, task board, Dream-Dollar treasury summary, but no editing rights                       | Pseudonymous data only, no private info          |

## 🎛️ Collaborator Tools

- **Creator Dashboard Access**: Add/Remove collaborators, assign roles, adjust permissions.
- **Privacy Settings**: 
  - Dreamers’ legal names and personal info = visible **only** to Creators.
  - Directors see pseudonyms + task history.
  - Managers see pseudonyms + task summaries.
  - Read-Only sees high-level summaries only.

- **Audit Trail**: 
  - Every action by collaborators logged in system (edits, approvals, assignments).

## 🛡️ Why It Matters

The cartel works when the power structure is clear:
- Creators lead.
- Directors guide.
- Managers execute.
- Dreamers build.
- Read-Only = silent observers.

No ambiguity. No confusion. Just roles, responsibilities, and radical transparency.

**OWN YOUR SH*T. BUILD THE DREAM.**
