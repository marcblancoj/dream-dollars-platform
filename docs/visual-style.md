# Visual Style Guide: Dream-Dollars

## 🎨 THE VIBE

Dream-Dollars is **punk-hacker-space cartel energy**. We don’t ask for permission—just take it. The aesthetic is raw, glitchy, anti-corporate. Think cosmic zine meets revolutionary warehouse.

### 🌌 THEME
- Cosmic deep space backgrounds: blacks, deep purples, electric blues, hot pinks.
- Neon rainbow trails (cosmic farts) as the ultimate middle finger to the system.
- Glitch art overlays: broken pixels, code fragments, analog static.
- Cartoon astronaut mascot (grinning revolutionary Mickey on a mission).
- Floating dollar signs, pixel icons, and alien-like symbols—money and meaning as cosmic chaos.

### 🔤 TYPOGRAPHY
- All-caps, stencil, hacked typeface: **OWN YOUR SH*T** energy.
- Grainy, smudged, torn edges—like a DIY zine from the 2080s.
- Bold neon headers with glitch accents.
- Text that flickers, breaks, and burns into the screen.

### 🎛️ UI ELEMENTS
- Buttons:
  - “START A DREAM” (hero button)
  - “CONTRIBUTE”
  - “SUPPORT”
- Button Style:
  - Zine-style button frame.
  - Glitchy hover effects (flicker, distortion, color shift).
- Navbar:
  - **MANIFESTO / HOW IT WORKS / DREAMS / SIGN UP / LOG IN**

### 🏴‍☠️ COLOR PALETTE (FINAL LOCK)

### 🧬 MASCOT RULES

### 💥 THE ENERGY
This isn’t a f***ing SaaS startup.
This is glitch art for the creative underground. Punk zines reimagined in the digital era. A rebellion in every pixel.

**OWN YOUR SH*T. BUILD THE DREAM.**
