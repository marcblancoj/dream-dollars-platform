# Task Management Guide: Dream-Dollars Platform

## üß≠ The Task Flow

Dream-Dollars runs on **creative labor, tracked tasks, and equitable payouts**. Here‚Äôs how **tasks flow** from vision to completion:

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Creators Define the Dream
- **Creators** (project founders) create a project.
- Set **task categories** (animation, writing, sound, design, code).
- Define **milestones** and key deliverables.
- Break down the dream into **bite-sized tasks**.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Dreamers Take the Tasks
- Dreamers browse available tasks in the **Dreamer Dashboard**.
- Each task includes:
  - Description, deliverables, and due date.
  - Assigned Dream-Dollars (value based on time/complexity).
  - Any reference files or links.
- Dreamers **self-assign** tasks (or are invited by Creators).

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Contributors Do the Work
- Dreamers complete tasks.
- Upload deliverables (files, designs, code, media).
- Log hours (if applicable).
- Submit for approval.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Creators & Collaborators Review
- **Project Directors** and **Managers** review submissions.
- Approve, request revisions, or reject.
- On approval:
  - Dream-Dollars released to the Dreamer.
  - Task marked complete.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Dream-Dollar Payouts
- Each approved task = Dream-Dollar units awarded.
- Dreamer‚Äôs ownership % in the project updates in real-time.
- Dreamers can track all tasks, completed work, and Dream-Dollar earnings in the **Dreamer Dashboard**.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Final Deliverables
- Once all tasks for a milestone are complete:
  - Creator approves milestone.
  - Platform tracks progress toward project completion.

---

## üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è The Rules
- **No tasks = no equity**: You earn Dream-Dollars through real work.
- **No flipping**: Dream-Dollars are non-transferable, non-speculative.
- **No ghosting**: If you don‚Äôt deliver, you don‚Äôt get paid.

---

## TL;DR
Tasks are the building blocks of the Dream. You take a task, you do the work, you get your cut.

**OWN YOUR SH*T. BUILD THE CARTEL.**
